The purpose of this project is to display my understand of basic HTML and CSS concepts by replicating the Google homepage. It definietly needs improvement in terms of structure, but I plan to come back to this project later and improve upon it. The goal is to organically improve my HTML/CSS knowledge rather than just copy and paste properties without understanding how the properties work.
